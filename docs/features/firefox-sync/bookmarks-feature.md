### Why should I use the bookmarks (places) component?
Building password management support via the Login component means that a team can have a core shared codebase in Rust, wrapped in native language bindings for supported platforms. Adding password syncing to a browser or browser-like application can be accomplished without having to worry about all the implementation details involved with syncing, storing and encrypting username and password data.

### What features are currently supported?
- Create, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations for bookmarks
- Syncing of bookmarks for devices and apps connected via Firefox Accounts
- Data migration functionality from Fennec to Firefox Preview storage
- ... more here

### Where can I learn more?
The [places component readme](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/blob/master/components/places/README.md) details how to use, test, measure and monitor it.

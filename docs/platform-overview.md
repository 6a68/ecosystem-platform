## What is Firefox Accounts

Firefox Accounts (FxA) is an identity provider that provides authentication and user profile data for Mozilla cloud services.  We are also exploring the possibility of allowing non-Mozilla services to delegate authentication to Firefox Accounts.

## What is the Subscription Platform

The Subscription Platform is a project to enable Firefox Accounts users to pay for Mozilla products and services.

## What are Synced Client Integrations

Sync & Account Client Integrations team builds foundational components for a connected ecosystem of Firefox products, empowering teams throughout Mozilla to build rich and consistent product experiences around our trusted stewardship of the user's personal browser data.
